## [*NixOS: Everything Everywhere All At Once*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfKlX3rA6E)

The one that started it all. A great introduction to NixOS focusing on the end-user's practical QoL benefits.

## [0atman's rebuild script](https://gist.github.com/0atman/1a5133b842f929ba4c1e195ee67599d5#file-nixos-rebuild-sh)

Used as a starting point for the [rebuild](../user/scripts/rebuild/default.nix) and [upgrade](../user/scripts/upgrade/default.nix) scripts.

## [Sioodmy's dotfiles](https://github.com/sioodmy/dotfiles)

> ### Mined the depths of the forbidden archives and learned the dark magic of the ***`flake`***.

The structure of this configuration was ~~shamelessly copied~~ *heavily inspired* by this repo. Although I'm not a Nix wizard like them, their dotfiles were incredibly helpful – simple, modular, and structured. I used them as a starting point to understand how flakes worked, and when I got how it was structured, realized it was very easy to modify to my own needs and tastes. Most of the resources I found online proposed Home Manager as a solution to what I was looking for, and this repo was immensely helpful in finding pure Nix alternatives.
